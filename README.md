# Comprehensive-Smartphone-Data-Pipeline
This project focuses on building an end-to-end data analytics pipeline by extracting smartphone product data from Croma and transforming it into meaningful business insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze smartphone market trends, pricing patterns, and feature distributions by converting raw web data into structured and actionable insights.
 
## Project Workflow
1️. <ins> Data Collection (Web Scraping)</ins>

Scraped smartphone product data including:

- Brand and Model Name
- Price
- Specifications (RAM, Storage, Battery, Display, etc.)
- Ratings and Product Features
- Automated data extraction using Python-based scraping techniques.

2. <ins>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</ins>

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized data formats for analysis
- Structured raw scraped data into an analyzable dataset

3️.<ins> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</ins>

- Analyzed smartphone pricing trends

- Studied relationships between price and specifications

- Identified brand-wise and feature-wise market patterns

- Generated statistical summaries and distribution insights

4️. <ins>Data Visualization</ins>

- Created visual dashboards and plots to represent:

- Price distribution across brands

- Feature comparison across smartphone categories

- Market trend patterns

- Specification vs Price relationship
